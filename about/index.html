		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I was born in 1996 in Madrid, Spain. I started my undergraduate studies in 2014 at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM), and in 2018 I obtained a degree in Physics. In 2016, at the same time, I started a Maths degree at UNED, which I am currently finishing.
			I had my first contact with researching during my Masters when I obtained a scholarship called "Ayudas para el Fomento de la Investigación en Estudios de Máster-UAM" under the supervision of Dr María del Mar González Nogueras. I successfully got a Masters in Maths called "Máster Universitario en Matemáticas y Aplicaciones" at UAM. My master thesis treated about the geometry of bounded critical systems. A new approach to understanding magnetic phase transitions in condensed matter.
			Since November 2019, I am an active member of ICMAT. I am currently working on my PhD under the supervision of Dr Ana María Mancho. My research line focuses on geophysical fluid dynamics, numerical simulations and dynamical systems.</p>
